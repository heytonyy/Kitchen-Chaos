# Kitchen Chaos

Project Showcase after completing CodeMonkey's Free Unity course in 3D game design. I had a great time learing C# and the Unity engine (this course was my first time using either), and I feel like this course was amazing on showing a variety of features and components native to Unity, as well as how to write clean, clear, and consise code while designing a video game. My plans is to complete the multi-player course that follows this one, potentially take CodeMonkey's next Unity course, then start designing my own games in Unity. After one course, I feel I have a great start and like the language/design structure, and with more practice I will future my skills.
