TODO: make pretty README.md later with more details.

GOAL: Learning to make 3D games in Unity & Learn C#. Following an indepth tutorial on making a "Overcooked" styled game. After this practice is finished, the plan is to make my own game inspired by Binding of Issac + Legend of Zelda 3D randomized dungeon crawler.
